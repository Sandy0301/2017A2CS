# This is the Christmas project--BlackJack
## Hanna & Sandy

#### Introduction
BlackJack is also known as twenty-one, which requires two players in our project. Each player draws card in turn. For each turn, the player makes decision according to their previous card: wether to continue or end drawing cards. The player whose sum is closer to 21 wins the game. If anyone gets a sum above 21, the program will end and display the result on the screen. Every time the game finishes, it will ask the user whether to play again or not.
